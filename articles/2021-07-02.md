## Introduction

There are a lot of programming languages in the world, but very few of them have datapacks as a compiler target.
So, let us define such a language and compile it to a datapack.

## Language 𝓗

First, let us define 𝓗, a high-level first-order language.

### First-Order Restriction

For brevity, 𝓗 is restricted to *first-order*.
The definition of "first-order" follows that of [[1](#1)]:

> ... we will say that a programming language is *higher-order* if procedures or labels can occur as data, i.e., if these entities can be used as arguments to procedures, as results of functions, or as values of assignable variables. A language that is not higher-order will be called *first-order*.

### Syntax

The syntax of 𝓗 is defined as follows:

```agda
        Variable  x, y

 Integer literal  n

 Function symbol  f

         Program  p     ::=  e                      (entry point)
                          |  f(x : A) : A = e; p    (function definition)

            Type  A, B  ::=  Int                    (integer type)

      Expression  e     ::=  x                      (variable)
                          |  n                      (integer literal)
                          |  f(e)                   (function application)
                          |  let x = e; e           (let binding)

           Value  v     ::=  x                      (variable)
                          |  n                      (integer literal)

       Signature  Σ     ::=  ∅                      (empty)
                          |  Σ, f(x : A) : A = e    (extension)

         Context  Γ     ::=  ∅                      (empty)
                          |  Γ, x : A               (extension)

Variable context  Δ     ::=  ∅                      (empty)
                          |  Δ, x                   (extension)
```

- `x` and `y` are metavariables ranging over variables.
- `n` is a metavariable ranging over literals of 32-bit signed integers.
- `f` is a metavariable ranging over function symbols.
- `p` is either an entry point or a function definition. The parameter and return types of the function are explicit. The arity of the function is always 1.
- `A` and `B` are always integer types.
- `e` is either a variable, an integer literal, a let binding, or a function application. Due to the first-order restriction, the function `f` must be fully-applied.
- `v` is either a variable or an integer literal. A value is a fully-evaluated expression.
- `Σ` is either an empty signature or a function extension. A signature is used to store global functions.
- `Γ` is either an empty context or a variable typing extension. A context is used to store local variables.
- `Δ` is either an empty variable context or a variable extension. A variable context is a type-erased context.

### Typing Rules

The unidirectional typing rules of 𝓗 is defined as follows:

```agda
Σ ⊢ p    Under signature Σ, program p is well-formed.


Σ; ∅ ⊢ e : A
------------ (entry)
Σ ⊢ e


Σ, f(x : A) : B = e; x : A ⊢ e : B    Σ, f(x : A) : B = e ⊢ p
-------------------------------------------------------------- (def)
Σ ⊢ f(x : A) : B = e; p
```

- `(entry)`: the entry point is well-formed if its expression is well-typed under the signature and the empty context.
- `(def)`: the function definition is well-formed if its body expression is well-typed under the signature extended itself and the context of its parameter only.

```agda
Σ; Γ ⊢ e : A    Under signature Σ and context Γ, expression e has type A.


x : A ∈ Γ
------------ (var)
Σ; Γ ⊢ x : A


-------------- (int)
Σ; Γ ⊢ n : Int


f(x : A) : B = _ ∈ Σ    Σ; Γ ⊢ e₁ : A
------------------------------------- (app)
Σ; Γ ⊢ f(e₁) : B


Σ; Γ ⊢ e₁ : A    Σ; Γ, x : A ⊢ e₂ : B
------------------------------------- (let)
Σ; Γ ⊢ let x = e₁; e₂ : B
```

Let us *bidirectionalize* [[2](#2)] the rules above.
The bidirectional typing rules of 𝓗 is defined as follows:

```agda
Σ ⊢ p    Under signature Σ, program p is well-formed.


Σ; ∅ ⊢ e ⇒ A
------------ (entry)
Σ ⊢ e


Σ, f(x : A) : B = e ; x : A ⊢ e ⇐ B    Σ, f(x : A) : B = e ⊢ p
-------------------------------------------------------------- (def)
Σ ⊢ f(x : A) : B = e; p
```

- `(entry)`: the expression of the entry point synthesizes the type `A` because we do not know the type.
- `(def)`: the body expression of the function checks against the type `B` because we know the type from the signature `Σ`.

```agda
Σ; Γ ⊢ e ⇐ A    Under signature Σ and context Γ, expression e checks against type A.
Σ; Γ ⊢ e ⇒ A    Under signature Σ and context Γ, expression e synthesizes type A.


x : A ∈ Γ
------------ (var⇒)
Σ; Γ ⊢ x ⇒ A


-------------- (int⇒)
Σ; Γ ⊢ n ⇒ Int


f(x : A) : B = _ ∈ Σ    Σ; Γ ⊢ e₁ ⇐ A
------------------------------------- (app⇒)
Σ; Γ ⊢ f(e₁) ⇒ B


Σ; Γ ⊢ e₁ ⇒ A    Σ; Γ, x : A ⊢ e₂ ⇐ B
------------------------------------- (let⇐)
Σ; Γ ⊢ let x = e₁; e₂ ⇐ B


Σ; Γ ⊢ e₁ ⇒ A    Σ; Γ, x : A ⊢ e₂ ⇒ B
------------------------------------- (let⇒)
Σ; Γ ⊢ let x = e₁; e₂ ⇒ B


Σ; Γ ⊢ e ⇒ A    A = B
--------------------- (sub⇒)
Σ; Γ ⊢ e ⇐ B
```

The rules above are all mode-correct, and thus directly implementable.

### Operational Semantics

The operational semantics of 𝓗 is defined as follows:

```agda
Σ ⊢ e ⟶ v    Under signature Σ, expression e evaluates to value v.


---------- (var)
Σ ⊢ x ⟶ x


---------- (int)
Σ ⊢ n ⟶ n


Σ ⊢ e₁ ⟶ v₁    f(x : _) : B = e₂ ∈ Σ    Σ ⊢ e₂[v₁/x] ⟶ v₂
----------------------------------------------------------- (app)
Σ ⊢ f(e₁) ⟶ v₂


Σ ⊢ e₁ ⟶ v₁    Σ ⊢ e₂[v₁/x] ⟶ v₂
---------------------------------- (let)
Σ ⊢ let x = e₁; e₂ ⟶ v₂
```

where the substitution is defined as follows:

```agda
               _[_/_] : Expression → Value → Variable → Expression
               y[v/x] = v                           where  x = y
               y[v/x] = y                           where  x ≠ y
               n[v/x] = n
            f(e)[v/x] = f(e[v/x])
(let y = e₁; e₂)[v/x] = (let y = e₁[v/x]; e₂)       where  x = y
(let y = e₁; e₂)[v/x] = (let y = e₁[v/x]; e₂[v/x])  where  x ≠ y
```

The operational semantics above uses substitution, which is recursive operation on syntax, to model function application.
This is not appropriate for datapacks.
So, we need to define a lower-level language than 𝓗 and compile 𝓗 to it first.

## Language 𝓛

Next, let us define 𝓛, a low-level first-order language.

### Syntax

The syntax of 𝓛 is defined as follows:

```agda
 Variable index  i

Integer literal  n

Function symbol  f

        Program  p  ::=  s           (entry point)
                      |  f = s; p    (function definition)

      Statement  s  ::=  ∅           (empty)
                      |  e; s        (sequence)

     Expression  e  ::=  i           (variable index)
                      |  n           (integer literal)
                      |  f           (function call)
                      |  return      (return marker)

          Value  v  ::=  n           (integer literal)

      Signature  Σ  ::=  ∅           (empty)
                      |  Σ, f = s    (extension)

          Stack  S  ::=  ∅           (empty)
                      |  S, v        (value extension)
```

- `i` is a metavariable ranging over variable indices. *De Bruijn index* [[3](#3)] is used for its representation.
- `n` is a metavariable ranging over literals of 32-bit signed integers.
- `f` is a metavariable ranging over function symbols.
- `p` is either an entry point or a function definition.
- `e` is either a variable index, an integer literal, a function call, or a return marker.
- `v` is always an integer literal.
- `Σ` is either an empty signature or a function extension.
- `S` is either an empty stack or a value extension. A stack is used to store local values.

### Compilation of 𝓗 to 𝓛

Let us compile 𝓗 to 𝓛. The compilation is defined as follows:

```agda
_⟦_⟧ : Variable context → 𝓗-Expression → 𝓛-Statement
Δ⟦x⟧              = Δ[x];
Δ⟦n⟧              = n;
Δ⟦f(e)⟧           = Δ⟦e⟧; f; return;
Δ⟦let x = e₁; e₂⟧ = Δ⟦e₁⟧; (Δ, x)⟦e₂⟧; return;
```

where the partial-function to calculate a variable index is defined as follows:

```agda
     _[_] : Variable context → Variable → Variable index
     ∅[x] = ⊥
(Δ, y)[x] = 0         where  x = y
(Δ, y)[x] = Δ[x] + 1  where  x ≠ y
```

The compilation is done recursively on 𝓗-Expressions.
In the cases of `f(e)` and `let x = e₁; e₂`, `return` is appended to the result statement.
These `return` markers are used to indicate where the value corresponding to the bound variable will be deallocated.

### Stack Semantics

To bring it closer to the execution in a real datapack, let us define the operational semantics with a stack.
The stack semantics of 𝓛 is defined as follows:

```agda
⟨S         |      i; s⟩ ⟶ ⟨S, S[i] |     s⟩                       (var)
⟨S         |      n; s⟩ ⟶ ⟨S, n    |     s⟩                       (int)
⟨S         |      f; s⟩ ⟶ ⟨S       | s₁; s⟩  where  f = s₁ ∈ Σ    (fun)
⟨S, v₂, v₁ | return; s⟩ ⟶ ⟨S, v₁   |     s⟩                       (ret)
```

where the partial-function to lookup the value at a specified variable index is defined as follows:

```agda
     _[_] : Stack → Variable index → Value
     ∅[i] = ⊥
(S, v)[0] = v
(S, v)[i] = S[i - 1]
```

The stack semantics is represented by the state transitions of pairs of `Stack` and `Statement`.
The global signature `Σ` contains all the definitions in the program.

- `(var)`: the `i`-th value in the stack `S` is looked up and pushed to `S`.
- `(int)`: the integer literal `n` is pushed to the stack `S`.
- `(fun)`: the body statement `s₁` of the function `f` is appended to the statement `s`.
- `(ret)`: the second value `v₂` is removed from the stack `S`.

Now we know how 𝓛 is executed with a stack.

## Compilation of 𝓛 to Datapack

Finally, let us compile 𝓛 to a datapack.
The compilation is straightforward and defined as follows:

```agda
⟦_⟧ : Program → Functions
⟦s⟧        = main ↦ "data modify storage _ stack set value []", ⟦s⟧
⟦f = s; p⟧ = f ↦ ⟦s⟧, ⟦p⟧
```

- `Functions` is a map from function symbols to `Commands`. Each entry `f ↦ cs` represents a single mcfunction with resource location `f` and commands `cs`.
- `main` is a special function symbol for the entry point. `/data modify` command to initialize the stack is prepended to its commands.

```agda
⟦_⟧ : Statement → Commands
⟦∅⟧    = ∅
⟦e; s⟧ = ⟦e⟧, ⟦s⟧
```

- `Commands` is a list of `Command`.

```agda
⟦_⟧ : Expression → Command
⟦i⟧      = "data modify storage _ S append from storage _ S[${-(i + 1)}]"
⟦n⟧      = "data modify storage _ S append value ${n}"
⟦f⟧      = "function ${f}"
⟦return⟧ = "data remove storage _ S[-2]"
```

- `Command` is a command.
- The variable index `i` is compiled to `/data modify` command. The index is converted to match that of Minecraft.
- The integer literal `n` is compiled to `/data modify` command to push it.
- The function call `f` is compiled to `/function` command to call it.
- The return marker `return` is compiled to `/data remove` to deallocate an out-of-scope value.

To execute the compiled program, execute `/function main`.

## Conclusion

We found that the first-order language 𝓗 can be compiled to a datapack.
Datapacks are expressive enough to be a compiler target for such a language.

Since we did not add any arithmetic operations or conditional branching to the language, we cannot write any non-trivial programs.
However, these could easily be added to the language.

We intentionally restricted the language to first-order.
This choice greatly simplifies the language design.
Although it is possible to compile a higher-order language to a datapack with transformations such as *defunctionalization* [[1](#1)], naïve implementation will result in poor performance.
Designing practical higher-order programming languages for Minecraft is non-trivial.
