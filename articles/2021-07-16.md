# Compiling Polymorphism with Type Passing

## Introduction

This is a short article about compiling polymorphic functions using *type passing* [[1](#1)].
Consider the following example:

```agda
id : (p : (A : Type) × A) → p.1
id ⟨_, a⟩ = a

main = id ⟨String, ""⟩
```

`id` is a closed polymorphic identity function, and `main` calls it.
`(a : A) × B` is a dependent product type, and `_.1` is its first projection.
Let us compile the code above with type passing, not monomorphization, which introduces code explosion.

## Erasure

The erasure erases types into tag types of NBT.
`Type` is erased into `ByteTag`, and its inhabitants are erased into a byte value.
The code above will be erased into:

```agda
id : (p : (A : ByteTag) × A) → p.1
id ⟨_, a⟩ = a

main = id ⟨7b, ""⟩
```

## Calling Convention

We have two data structures for function call: *argument* and *return*.
Each structure has finite *slots* to store values, and each slot has *monomorphic stacks*.
The relationship of caller and callee is:

### Caller

1. Store the arguments to the argument structure.
1. Call the function.

### Callee

1. Execute the code.
1. Store the return values to the return structure.
1. Drop all the arguments in the argument structure.

## Compilation

Let us compile the code above into a datapack.
We use the following macros for readability.
The macro `let x := v` is embedded in a command as `⟦x⟧` and expanded to `v`.

```lean
let arg    := 0
let ret    := 1

let poly   := -12
let top    := -1
let #0     := 0
let #1     := 1
let #2     := 2
...

let byte   := 0
...
let int    := 2
...
let string := 7
...

let type   := int
```

- <samp>main.mcfunction</samp>
```mcfunction
# id ⟨String, ""⟩
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦type  ⟧] append value ⟦string⟧b
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#1⟧][⟦string⟧] append value ""
  function id
```
- <samp>id.mcfunction</samp>
```mcfunction
# select ⟨ret, #0, A⟩
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦byte⟧] append value ⟦ret⟧b
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#1⟧][⟦int ⟧] append value ⟦#0⟧
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#2⟧][⟦type⟧] append from storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦type⟧][⟦top⟧]
  function select

# select ⟨arg, #1, A⟩
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦byte⟧] append value ⟦arg⟧b
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#1⟧][⟦int ⟧] append value ⟦#1⟧
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#2⟧][⟦type⟧] append from storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦type⟧][⟦top⟧]
  function select

# a
  data modify storage _ _[⟦ret⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦poly⟧] append from storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#1⟧][⟦poly⟧][⟦top⟧]

# drop ⟨arg, #0, A⟩
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦byte⟧] append value ⟦arg⟧b
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#1⟧][⟦int ⟧] append value ⟦#0⟧
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#2⟧][⟦type⟧] append from storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦type⟧][⟦top⟧]
  function drop

# drop ⟨arg, #1, Type⟩
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#0⟧][⟦byte⟧] append value ⟦arg⟧b
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#1⟧][⟦int ⟧] append value ⟦#1⟧
  data modify storage _ _[⟦arg⟧][⟦#2⟧][⟦type⟧] append value ⟦type⟧
  function drop
```

where `select ⟨a, b, c⟩` selects the stack `c` in the slot `b` of the structure `a`, and `drop ⟨a, b, c⟩` drops the top value of the stack `c` in the slot `b` of the structure `a`.
The selection is performed by the standard list shifting, and the selected stack can be referenced by `_[⟦a⟧][⟦b⟧][⟦poly⟧]`.

Although the output is pretty unoptimized, it can be optimized by fusion, etc.
We avoided monomorphization to prevent code explosion, but we could *pass types at compile-time* by staging if performance is critical.

## Conclusion

We can now compile the polymorphic function into a single shared code with type passing.
This could be the way to selectively reduce the footprint of datapacks at the cost of reduced performance.

We have not yet been able to compile size-polymorphism, where the size of types is unknown at compile-time.
Compiling size-polymorphism without introducing code explosion and losing expressiveness is the future work.
