# Modular Defunctionalization Using Function Tags

## Introduction

First-class functions are essential to modern programming languages, whereas datapacks do not have them.
We can neither store a function in storage nor call it from storage.
The lack of first-class functions severely restricts API design.
Is it possible to emulate first-class functions somehow?

The answer is yes.
We can use a technique called *defunctionalization*[^1] to eliminate first-class functions from our program.
We will briefly discuss defunctionalization in the next section.

## Defunctionalization in General

Defunctionalization converts every function in the program to a *closure*, which is a pair of function tags and environment, and every application in the program to a function call to the dispatcher which calls the function corresponding to the given function tag.

Let's look at an example in JavaScript.
Consider the following higher-order program.

```js
const twice = f => x => f(f(x));
const add = x => y => x + y;
const main = twice(add(1))(2);
```

First, give a unique tag to all first-class functions.
```js
const twice = f /* 0 */=> x /* 1 */=> f(f(x));
const add = x /* 2 */=> y /* 3 */=> x + y;
const main = twice(add(1))(2);
```

Then, convert a first-class function `x /* i */=> e` to a closure `{tag: i, env: all-the-free-variables-in-e}` and an application `f(x)` to a dispatcher call `dispatch(f, x)`.
The function `dispatch` takes a closure `clo` and an argument `arg`, and branches based on the function tag `clo.tag`.

```js
function dispatch(clo, arg) {
    if (clo.tag === 0) {
        const [{}, f] = [clo.env, arg];
        return {tag: 1, env: {f}};
    } else if (clo.tag === 1) {
        const [{f}, x] = [clo.env, arg];
        return dispatch(f, dispatch(f, x));
    } else if (clo.tag === 2) {
        const [{}, x] = [clo.env, arg];
        return {tag: 3, env: {x}};
    } else if (clo.tag === 3) {
        const [{x}, y] = [clo.env, arg];
        return x + y;
    }
}

const twice = {tag: 0, env: {}};
const add = {tag: 2, env: {}};
const main = dispatch(dispatch(twice, dispatch(add, 1)), 2);
```

Notice that there is no first-class function in the program above.
We have successfully defunctionalized the higher-order program!
Using this technique, we can embed first-class functions into a language without first-class functions.

## Defunctionalization in Minecraft

The defunctionalized program in the previous section can be easily translated into mcfunctions.
However, there is one serious problem: defunctionalization is a whole-program transformation and thus is not modular.
If we take a closer look at `dispatch` again, we can see that it contains both implementations of `twice` and `add`.
If `twice` and `add` were defined in different datapacks, `dispatch` could not be defined using functions.

This is where function tags come in.
`values` of the function tags of the same name are concatenated on load if not `replace`.
Using this feature, we can create `dispatch` at runtime by concatenating the functions defined in each datapack.

Let's implement the previous program in datapack.
We will use three datapacks for `twice`, `add`, and `main` respectively.

- `main/data/minecraft/functions/init.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
scoreboard objectives remove _
scoreboard objectives add _ dummy

data modify storage _ closures set value []
data modify storage _ integers set value []
```
- `main/data/minecraft/functions/dispatch.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
data modify storage _ tag set from storage _ closures[-1].tag
data modify storage _ branched set value false
function #dispatch
```
- `main/data/minecraft/tags/functions/dispatch.json`
```json
{
    "values": []
}
```
- `twice/data/twice/functions/0/_.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if data storage _ {branched: false, tag: "twice:0"} run function twice:0/
```
- `twice/data/twice/functions/0/.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
data modify storage _ closures append value {tag: "twice:1"}
data modify storage _ closures[-1].env.f set from storage _ closures[-3]

data remove storage _ closures[-2]
data remove storage _ closures[-2]

data modify storage _ branched set value true
```
- `twice/data/twice/functions/1/_.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if data storage _ {branched: false, tag: "twice:1"} run function twice:1/
```
- `twice/data/twice/functions/1/.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
    data modify storage _ closures append from storage _ closures[-1].env.f
  function dispatch
  data modify storage _ closures append from storage _ closures[-1].env.f
function dispatch

data remove storage _ closures[-1]

data modify storage _ branched set value true
```
- `twice/data/minecraft/tags/functions/dispatch.json`
```json
{
    "values": [
        "twice:0/_",
        "twice:1/_"
    ]
}
```
- `add/data/add/functions/0/_.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if data storage _ {branched: false, tag: "add:0"} run function add:0/
```
- `add/data/add/functions/0/.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
data modify storage _ closures append value {tag: "add:1"}
data modify storage _ closures[-1].env.x set from storage _ integers[-1]

data remove storage _ closures[-2]
data remove storage _ integers[-1]

data modify storage _ branched set value true
```
- `add/data/add/functions/1/_.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if data storage _ {branched: false, tag: "add:1"} run function add:1/
```
- `add/data/add/functions/1/.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute store result score x _ run data get storage _ closures[-1].env.x
execute store result score y _ run data get storage _ integers[-1]
execute store result storage _ integers[-1] int 1.0 run scoreboard players operation x _ += y _

data remove storage _ closures[-1]

data modify storage _ branched set value true
```
- `add/data/minecraft/tags/functions/dispatch.json`
```json
{
    "values": [
        "add:0/_",
        "add:1/_"
    ]
}
```
- `twice/data/twice/functions/twice.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
data modify storage _ closures append value {tag: "twice:0"}
```
- `add/data/add/functions/add.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
data modify storage _ closures append value {tag: "add:0"}
```
- `main/data/main/functions/main.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
  data modify storage _ integers append value 2
      data modify storage _ integers append value 1
      function add:add
    function dispatch
    function twice:twice
  function dispatch
function dispatch
```

Note that we use resource locations as tags for better modularity.
When we run `init` and then `main:main`, it will return `4` as expected.

## Conclusion

We can manually perform defunctionalization in datapacks to emulate first-class functions in a modular way.
