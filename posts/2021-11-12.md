# Pass-by-Context: Zero Runtime Cost Argument Passing

In Minecraft languages, the simplest way to pass arguments is *pass-by-value*.
However, pass-by-value suffers from performance problems.
In this post, we will consider the new way to pass arguments at zero runtime cost: *pass-by-context*.

## Pass-by-Value

In pass-by-value, the arguments are copied and pushed onto the stack.
Argument lookup is very fast and takes a constant time.
Because the arguments are deep-copied, pass-by-value is not very efficient for passing large objects.
In order to deal with this, we can pass pointers instead, as in C.
However, unlike C, random access is extremely slow in Minecraft.
Even with the state-of-the-art random access data structure, indexing takes `O(logÂ²n)` time.
We are faced with two choices: (1) slow-passing and fast-lookup or (2) fast-passing and slow-lookup.
Can we get the best of both worlds, that is, fast-passing and fast-lookup?

## Pass-by-Context

To achieve fast-passing and fast-lookup, we use a *non-commutative type system*.
A non-commutative type system is a *substructural type system* that discards the exchange rule.
We restrict the type system so that every variable is used in the reverse order it was introduced.

Let's see an example:

```lean
def f[a : list(int)](n : int) : int =
  if n == 0 then
    0
  else
    do_something[a]()
    f[a](n - 1)

def g[]() : int =
  let [x] = list_of(0, 1, 2)
  let [y] = list_of(3, 4, 5)
  f[y](0)
  f[x](1)
  -- f[y](2)    error!
```

In `f`, we use non-commutative parameters `[a : list(int)]` to introduce a non-commutative variable `a`, and use it twice.
In `g`, we introduce non-commutative variables `x` and `y`, and use them in the reverse order.
Weakening of `y` is performed implicitly before `f[x](1)`, otherwise we cannot use `x`.
`f[y](2)` will raise an error since `y` has already been weakened.

Let's see another example with multiple non-commutative parameters:

```lean
def f[a : list(int), b : list(int)](n : int) : int =
  if n == 0 then
    0
  else
    do_something[b]()
    f[a, b](n - 1)

def g[]() : int =
  let [x] = list_of(0, 1, 2)
  let [y] = list_of(3, 4, 5)
  let [z] = list_of(6, 7, 8)
  f[z, z](0)
  f[y, z](1)
  -- f[x, z](2)    error!
  f[x, y](3)
```

`f[x, z](2)` will raise an error because it skips `y`.
Optionally we can disallow `f[z, z](0)` to ensure non-interference and to reduce code duplication.

Operationally, non-commutative parameters allow us to peek at the contextual stack to check a few objects from the top of it.
This way of argument passing is very efficient because once the argument is pushed onto the stack, it will never be copied and will be looked up like pass-by-value.
We call this *pass-by-context* because non-commutative variables work as contextual information of the program.

## Future Work

- Non-Commutative Context Splitting
  - We could relax the non-commutative restriction if contexts are split by type or user-defined name.
- Region-Based Memory Management
  - We could implement region-based memory management using pass-by-context.

## Conclusion

Pass-by-context provides us a way to pass arguments at zero runtime cost while maintaining ergonomics in mind.
