# Sequential Dispatch with Sibling Pointers

In Minecraft, we sometimes create a dispatch tree as follows:

```agda
         ┌─┐
    ┌────┤ ├────┐
    │    └─┘    │
   ┌▼┐         ┌▼┐
 ┌─┤ ├─┐     ┌─┤ ├─┐
 │ └─┘ │     │ └─┘ │
┌▼┐   ┌▼┐   ┌▼┐   ┌▼┐
│0│   │1│   │2│   │3│
└─┘   └─┘   └─┘   └─┘
```

- `0-3.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if score index _ matches 0..1 run function 0-1
execute if score index _ matches 2..3 run function 2-3
```
- `0-1.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if score index _ matches 0 run function 0
execute if score index _ matches 1 run function 1
```
- `2-3.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
execute if score index _ matches 2 run function 2
execute if score index _ matches 3 run function 3
```
- `0.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
# 0
execute if score remaining _ matches ..-1 run scoreboard players add * _ 1
```
- `1.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
# 1
execute if score remaining _ matches ..-1 run scoreboard players add * _ 1
```
- `2.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
# 2
execute if score remaining _ matches ..-1 run scoreboard players add * _ 1
```
- `3.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
# 3
execute if score remaining _ matches ..-1 run scoreboard players add * _ 1
```

At each of the internal nodes, a branch will be taken depending on the given index.
At each of the leaf nodes, the corresponding function will be dispatched.
Thanks to fall-through, we can access the next leaf node by increasing the index by `1` at the leaf node.
However, this is not very efficient due to preorder traversal, rather than sequential access.
Instead, we can add a sibling pointer to each of the leaf nodes as follows:

```agda
         ┌─┐
    ┌────┤ ├────┐
    │    └─┘    │
   ┌▼┐         ┌▼┐
 ┌─┤ ├─┐     ┌─┤ ├─┐
 │ └─┘ │     │ └─┘ │
┌▼┐   ┌▼┐   ┌▼┐   ┌▼┐
│0├───►1├───►2├───►3│
└─┘   └─┘   └─┘   └─┘
```

# 0
scoreboard players add remaining 1
execute if score remaining _ matches ..0 run function 1
```

```mcfunction
# 1
scoreboard players add remaining 1
execute if score remaining _ matches ..0 run function 2
```
- `2.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
# 2
scoreboard players add remaining 1
execute if score remaining _ matches ..0 run function 3
```
- `3.mcfunction`
```mcfunction
# 3
```

In this way, we can cut off preorder traversal and directly access the next leaf node.

## Conclusion and Future Work

A function call is like moving through a call graph.
Sibling pointers allowed us to exploit our current position.
It might be a good idea to consider more complex dispatch graphs.
